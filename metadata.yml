Title: Efflux susceptibility in gram-negative bacteria
Description: Actives in efflux-compromised Escherichia coli were compared with 
  wild-type strains to estimate efflux susceptibility of small molecules. An 
  initial screen of over 300000 molecules was performed in an efflux-deficient 
  (tolC mutant) strain. About 4500 hits (E.coli growth inhibitors) were 
  identified, of which ca. 3, 780 were efflux-dependent (meaning they do not 
  inhibit the WT). In addition, from the 4500 subset, two more refined datasets 
  were created classifying 1061 molecules as pumped out and 404 as non-pumped.
