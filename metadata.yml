Title: Efflux susceptibility of small molecule inhibitors in gram-negative bacteria
Description: Actives in efflux-compromised Escherichia coli were compared with wild-type
  strains to estimate efflux susceptibility of small molecules. An initial screen
  of over 300, 000 molecules was performed in an efflux-deficient (tolC mutant) strain.
  About 4, 500 hits were identified, of which ca. 3, 780 were efflux-dependent (meaning
  they do not inhibit the WT). In addition, ca. 1000 and 400 molecules were classified
  as pumped or non-pumped, respectively.
